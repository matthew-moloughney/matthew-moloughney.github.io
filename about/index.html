I have a BN (Mental Health) 2:1 from Swansea University alongside an MSc with Distinction from Cardiff University.
After qualifying as a psychiatric nurse I held positions as a staff nurse, deputy ward manager and community nurse before seeking to complete an MSc which would allow me to focus on teaching, a part of each of my nursing posts I had enjoyed most."

<p>My name is Matthew and I am a part-time Teaching Associate and part-time Post-Graduate Research student at Cardiff University, COMSC.</p>
<p>I have a BN (Mental Health) 2:1 from Swansea University alongside an MSc with Distinction from Cardiff University.</p>
<p>After qualifying as a psychiatric nurse I held positions as a staff nurse, deputy ward manager and community nurse before seeking to complete an MSc which would allow me to focus on teaching, a part of each of my nursing posts I had enjoyed most.</p>
<p><em>Why teaching</em>?</p>
<p>With a background in psychiatry, the drive in my day-to-day work is to engage with individuals, understand personal-goals and help to realise potential.  Fundamental aspects of teaching.  I reason - why anything else?</p>
<p>A position was offered at Cardiff University COMSC on completion of my MSc - and with this, the opportunity to undertake a funded PhD.</p>
<p><em>Why Computer Science</em>?</p>
<p>The possibilities for cross-discipline working and sharing that CS education can facilitate, was a major factor in my decision to make the jump.</p>
<p>Being a part of a multi-disciplinary team, collaborating to achieve planned outcomes with a focus on end-user experiences and making processes more efficient are some of the aspects I particularly enjoy, which serve to motivate my research and teaching in Higher Education.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-teaching">My Teaching:</h2>
<p>As a Teaching Associate, I have provided support for teaching and assessment in the following modules:</p>
<p><em>2019-20</em></p>
<ul>
<li>CMT115 <em>Python for Computation</em></li>
<li>CMT112 <em>Computational Systems</em></li>
<li>CMT303 <em>Software Engineering</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>2020-21</em></p>
<ul>
<li>TBC</li>
<li>TBC</li>
<li>TBC</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as supporting teaching and assessment, I have undertaken dissertation moderation for undergraduate final-year students and MSc students, and also facilitated formal student support drop-in sessions providing both flexible teaching and pastoral support.
I have a pending application to the HEA for Associate Fellow - with a view to Fellowship by the end of the 2022/23 academic cycle.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-research">My research:</h2>
<p>My part-time PhD is undertaken with the supervision of Dr Martin Chorley, Ms Helen Phillips and Dr Kath Jones.  My research considers Automated Assessment Tools (AATs) for novice programmers in the Higher Education setting, which acquire student feedback.<br>
With a view toward enhancing co-collaboration between teaching-staff and students in larger cohorts.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
